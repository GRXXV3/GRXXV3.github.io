            <h2>WEEK 2</h2>
            <h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
            </h3>
                <p>The various visuals and interactive elements on the website definitely caught my attention, it is something that I usually don’t come across. There was no traditional navigation bar, but instead there were different little image icons at the top bar that you can click on to be shown different audio-visual interactive projects. 
                </p>

            <h3>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
            </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of different interactive elements throughout all of the various projects.</li>
                    <li>Most of these elements are interactive upon moving the mouse around for a certain amount of time, even clicking the mouse would also move these different elements, it creates an immersive experience.</li>
                    <li>Playing around with the various art projects makes me curious about the meaning of each.</li>
                    <li>The audio really supports the visual of each of the projects, making it really cool and interesting to experience.</l>
                    <li>Moving between each of the projects is relatively smooth despite it being a 3D visual-audio heavy based core website. </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
                <p><i>THRIST</i> was the project that I had spent the most time engaging with. It was the only project where you could customise the 3D model. There is a drop down bar with a list of customisation options, therefore you could create countless customisations options that you could play around with. The music actually changes and is different each time, one cool element that really enhances the interactive experience is how the different lightings are matched to the beat of the music. </p>
            
            <h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
                <p>There were a lot of moving the mouse around in different directions in order to interact and to move objects around with the various 3D models, this was the most common action during my interaction with the website. 
                </p>
            
            <h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
                <p><i>Fractal Fantasy (FF)</i> blends both interactive visuals and experimental music that creates an immersive experience that lets users explore audiovisuals like never before. The intended primary goal seems to be having a space that can show utopian styles of interactive audio-visual. I think they were able to create such a creative platform that is able to showcase different virtual interactive audio-visual futuristic spaces that are innovative and pair very well with their name Fractal Fantasy. </p>
            
            <h3>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
                <p>Anything that may come to mind when you think of utopia visuals and even elements that you could not have imagined can be seen on the website. These interactive audio-visual experiences communicate well to the previously mentioned primary goal, as it also allows users to engage the futuristic visuals element on a deeper level.</p>

            <h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
            </h3>
                <p>Personally it's not a website that I would visit frequently, however it would be more of a website that I would come by when in need of being inspired or if I’m bored. As it's either an informational website therefore wouldn't be consistently updated and artwork creations take time. I think coming back to the website once in a while would be more fun to interact with, otherwise you could get bored pretty quickly. 
                </p>

            <h3>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
                <p>The interactive elements are set in a utopian future, it may be predicting the possible future of audio-visuals in this “fantasy”. Overtime I think it's something that will be implemented even more in the future of the world of 3D interactive audio-visuals, it is definitely something experimental. Use it as a space to discover and be curious through different interactions to capture the future of audio-visuals.

            <h3>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
                <p>In a way it does remind me of the 3D audio-visuals that can be seen at music festivals, these 3D models are designed to move in a certain way to pair along with the DJ’s set, it creates an immersive experience that the users/audience are craving these days. Fractal Fantasy is able to bring you just that as an interactive experience on their website, there you can even have the option to customise to enhance the experience. </p>
    
            <h3>10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
                <p>Be open and curious to engage in both the audio and visual elements of each interactive project, taking the time to really play around with the visuals and listening to the paired audio really enhances the experience. </p>
    
            <h3>11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
                <p>It communicates that you can step into this designed augmented universe and are able to feel what it could be like to be in a futuristic reality with the combination of audio-visuals, 3D and 360 content to create these intuitive experiences. 
                </p>
    
            <h3>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
                <p>There isn’t much information mentioned on the website about what the website is about or what each project is about. Unless you were already familiar with the duo that created Fractal Fantasy. It can make you feel lost as you are just thrown into browsing through these different audio-visual interfaces. 
                </p>
    
            <h3>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
                <p>For sure the customisation options that are featured for two of the projects,<i>THRIST</i> and <i>LIQUID ENTROPY</i>. This makes the interaction feel more immersive and fun to play around with, it feels like you are being transported into Fractal Fantasy’s world as you actively engage with these projects, instead of just looking through it.
